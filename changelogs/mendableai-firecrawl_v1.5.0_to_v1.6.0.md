# üî• firecrawl Changelog: v1.5.0 ‚Üí v1.6.0 (2025-03-06)

This release introduces a major overhaul of AI integrations using the Vercel AI SDK, enabling support for Ollama, Claude 3.7, GPT-4.5, and generic OpenAI-compatible APIs. Significant progress was made on the Deep Research Alpha feature, alongside numerous improvements to crawling logic, self-hosting capabilities, performance via database read replicas, and various bug fixes across the platform. New examples showcasing integrations with different AI models have also been added.
